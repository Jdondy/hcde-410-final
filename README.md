# hcde-410-final

Final project for hcde 410 class, analyzing data of my choice. 

This dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and after searching for a Cleveland dataset that doesn’t have as many issues, I found this one. The Kaggle usability score for this dataset is 8.82, falling short of a 10 because it is not updated frequently, however, that’s not really applicable for this dataset anyway. The original source is: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease. And the Kaggle link is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci The Kaggle license links to Reddit API terms: https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api .

-From the author: “The data is already presented in https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci but there are some descriptions and values that are wrong as discussed in https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/discussion/105877. So, here is re-processed dataset that was cross-checked with the original data https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease.”
